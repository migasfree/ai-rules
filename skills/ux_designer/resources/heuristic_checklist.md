# Heuristic Evaluation Checklist (Nielsen)

- [ ] **Visibility of system status**: Does the user always know what is happening? (e.g., progress bars, spinners).
- [ ] **Match between system and the real world**: Do we use language and concepts familiar to the user (not internal jargon)?
- [ ] **User control and freedom**: Can users undo/redo or easily exit unwanted states?
- [ ] **Consistency and standards**: Do similar actions look and behave the same way everywhere?
- [ ] **Error prevention**: are there confirmation dialogs for destructive actions?
- [ ] **Recognition rather than recall**: Are objects, actions, and options visible? (Minimize memory load).
- [ ] **Flexibility and efficiency of use**: Are there shortcuts for power users (CLI aliases, keyboard shortcuts)?
- [ ] **Aesthetic and minimalist design**: Is irrelevant information removed?
- [ ] **Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors**: Are error messages in plain language and do they suggest a solution?
- [ ] **Help and documentation**: Is help easily searchable and focused on the user's task?
